# Results (Placeholder)

This section will report quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, reconstruction error) and qualitative visual comparisons. It should include ablation results for mixing/normalization strategies and any benchmarking on held-out data.

Relevant sources to draw from:
- `../training_inference.md` for evaluation outputs and tensor shapes
- `../methods.md` for metric definitions and evaluation protocol
- `../mixing_experiments.md` for experimental observations
