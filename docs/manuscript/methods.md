# Methods (Placeholder)

This section will detail data acquisition, preprocessing, synthetic mixing, model architecture, training, and evaluation protocols. It should include the full experimental pipeline and configuration settings used for reproducibility.

Relevant sources to draw from:
- `../data_generation.md` for preprocessing and synthetic mixing steps
- `../methods.md` for the manuscript-style protocol
- `../networks/dual_unet.md` for the dual U-Net architecture
- `../mission_statement.md` for the mixing model assumptions
