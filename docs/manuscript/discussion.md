# Discussion (Placeholder)

This section will interpret results, discuss limitations (linearity assumptions, detector non-idealities), and propose future work. It should also reflect on generalization to additional phases or real experimental data.

Relevant sources to draw from:
- `../mission_statement.md` for assumptions and limitations
- `../roadmap.md` for future work directions
- `../status.md` for current implementation status
